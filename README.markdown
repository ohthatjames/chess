Chess
=====

A basic chess library in Ruby that I'm using to practise TDD.

I'm trying as much as possible to have only one failing test at a time and allowing my tests to guide my implementation.

I'm committing in small chunks and describing the decisions I make as I go in the commit messages.

At the moment boards can have pieces (as strings) and these pieces can be moved. The rules haven't been implemented yet, so boards can end up in invalid states.

This is very much a learning exercise, so any feedback would be great. Please leave comments on commits, raise github issues, or better yet fork the repository and show me what I'm doing wrong!
